# NewsApi

# Who I am?

Hello my name is Light Yagami, obviously it's not my real name, it's just a pseudonym
I took from my favorite Anime Death Note, I'm from the Dominican Republic and I'm learning frontend development in a self-taught way and to make the pieces fit I build projects. My goal in programming is to become an excellent software engineer, and I work very hard to achieve this. I am currently learning Angular, at first as usual I was intimidated as I had only worked with Html, Css and JavaScript. 
It is normal to feel afraid when leaving the comfort zone, so you already know.

# What is this project?

This project is done in Angular which is part of a course I'm taking on application development with Angular. Obviously, I extended the project further, adding more functionality and some components I needed to achieve that functionality. 
Angular is a framework maintained by Google, written in TypeScript and everyone should learn, it is a component based framework for building scalable web applications, it is a good option to have in your toolboxes. App News is a web application to search for news of interest today, you can filter the categories and countries, for example, category Entertainment, country Mexico, and the App will search Mexico for news that belongs to Entertainment. The app consumes a free API called News API, which is the one that looks for that information and then shows it to the user. In some styles I used Bootstrap, Bootstrap icons and bootswatch. I hope I have detailed well how the App works, it is the first time I have done it.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
